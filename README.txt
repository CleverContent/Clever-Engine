Clever is a game engine / level designer. It handles both the rendering, physics, AI calucation, player input, Window managing, etc. As well as the level loading, creating, and manipulating.

Clever DOES NOT support custom script for custom event. For example: you cannot write a script to generate particles when velocity is greater than 0. The entire world and effects of the world are controlled
through the material system, physics system, and magic system. You can manipulate those three to get your desired world and effects.
